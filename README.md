<strong><em>Social Networks</em></strong>

This project is a programming assignment in C which aims to find influencer peaople in a social graph. Your program will read a data file containing a list of people names and the friendness they have. You will build a graph from the given data file. The vertices of the graph will be the people and there will be an edge between each person who have a friendness relationship.

You will process the graph and make the necessary calculations. The output of your program will be

<ol>

 <li>a representation of the graph you generated (can be viewed like adjacency matrix) and</li>

 <li>the centrality degrees .</li>

</ol>

The input will be in the following format:

Cem; Ayşe, Ferit, Dundar
